# SBT project template

Provides a template for SBT projects with some explanation to understand the details. Anything not obvious has been commented in the corresponding file, for quick reference.

The project provides the structure for:

* a service (server side)
* a client to that service
* a shared model
* acceptance tests on the client
* shell scripts with common behaviour

Everything is standard sbt so it can be ported to Activator projects or similar. Code is under package *project* (rename as needed)

Feel free to copy it and use it for your own projects.
